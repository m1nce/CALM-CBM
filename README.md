# Contextual Latent Embedding for Adaptive Representation

The **CLEAR** framework is designed to advance label-free concept bottleneck methods 
by developing a **contextually adaptive Latent space** that enhances interpretability 
and robustness in complex, real-world settings. By using unsupertvissed learning techniques, 
CLEAR identifies latent pseudo-concepts within data, enabling the model to distinguish 
between agenuine operational anomalies and context-induced variations (such as environmental changes 
or sensor noise). CLEAR's statistical foundations and context-awareness allow for a structured, 
interpretable bottleneck layer that makes data patterns more transparent and actionable, 
even in the absence of labeled data.
